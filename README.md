# RaidCraft

RaidCraft is an application to coordinate loot drops in Classic World of Warcraft. Log in and add your friends' Battletags. Create your WoW characters and their wishlists -- then when you're ready, schedule a run. You'll be able to mark who received which drop and which drops are disenchanted.

The application has two components - The phone application written in React Native, and the server backend written in Ruby on Rails.
